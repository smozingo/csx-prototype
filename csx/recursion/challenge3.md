### Challenge 3

Calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence, the famous sequence where each value is the sum of the previous two values. Assume that our sequence begins with 0 and 1.
For your reference, here are the first ten terms of the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34. So if our function input is 7, then we should return the 7th term, which is 8.
```
// Input:  {Integer} - n
// Output: {Integer}

function fibonacci(n) {

}
```
