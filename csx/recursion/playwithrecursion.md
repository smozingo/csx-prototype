### Play with Recursion

Now that you know the basics, try writing a factorial function with recursion! Factorials take an input and multiply that input by all integers below itself until 1. For example, if the input is 4, then you should return 24, which is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.
Don’t proceed with the chapter until you’ve built factorial and understand how recursion works at a basic level!
